**Keywords:** Optics & condensed matter physics, femtosecond laser-writing, photonic lattices,
periodically modulated (Floquet) waveguide arrays, nonlinear topological photonics, spatial solitons.

Our goal is to apply photonic technologies to discover new physics and find their applications, going beyond the traditional scope of 
optics and condensed matter physics. We study how optical states propagate along intricately designed waveguide networks that are 
created inside a few cm long glass substrates using femtosecond laser pulses. <br />

Our current research topics include <br />

   - Manipulating light transport in evanescently coupled waveguide arrays,
   - Micro-optic device fabrication using femtosecond laser pulses, 
   - Periodically modulated (Floquet) photonic structures,
   - Photonic topological insulators,
   - Optical Kerr nonlinearity 
    
**Floquet engineering & Photonic topological insulators** <br />

Floquet engineering (i.e., applying a 'time'-periodic driving to a static system) is a convenient way of creating novel Hamiltonians, realizing synthetic gauge fields and topologically non-trivial energy bands. We aim to implement various periodic driving protocols by modulating waveguide paths and/or the instantaneous refractive index (i.e., the on-site energy). A suitable periodic modulation effectively breaks time-reversal symmetry and creates topologically non-trivial photonic bands.<br />
