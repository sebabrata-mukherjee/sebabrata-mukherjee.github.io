periodically modulated (Floquet) waveguide arrays, linear & nonlinear topological photonics, spatial solitons.

Our goal is to apply photonic technologies to discover new physics and find their applications, going beyond the traditional scope of 
optics and condensed matter physics. We study how optical states propagate along intricately designed waveguide networks that are 
created inside a few cm long glass substrates using femtosecond laser pulses. <br />

Our current research topics include <br />

   - Manipulating light transport in evanescently coupled waveguide arrays,
   - Micro-optic device fabrication using femtosecond laser pulses, 
   - Periodically modulated (Floquet) photonic structures,
   - Photonic topological insulators,
   - Optical Kerr nonlinearity

Floquet engineering (i.e., applying a 'time'-periodic driving to a static system) is a convenient way of creating novel Hamiltonians, realizing synthetic gauge fields and topologically non-trivial energy bands. Using engineered waveguide networks, we can implement various driving protocols and realize Floquet topological materials for light waves. Topologically robust back-scatter immune optical states can propagate unidirectionally through such waveguide circuits.

**Nonlinear/interacting topological photonics** <br />
Photonic lattices -- periodic arrays of optical waveguides -- are a natural platform for exploring mean-field-type interactions arising from the optical Kerr effect (i.e., a variation of the refractive index in proportion to the local intensity of light). At high intensity, photons can *effectively* interact, mediated by the ambient medium. In experiments, we temporally shape laser pulses such that the dynamics of light through the engineered waveguide arrays are governed by the discrete nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (DNSE). The DNSE is mathematically equivalent to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which describes bosonic interactions in a Bose-Einstein condensate in the mean-field limit. Our goal is to understand the role of interactions/nonlinearity in topologically nontrivial systems. <br />

**Femtosecond laser writing** <br />
<img align="right" src="imageN/FLW3.png  " width="380"/> 
We use intense femtosecond laser pulses to modify optical properties (e.g., refractive index) of transparent dielectric materials. This is a unique and powerful technique for creating complex three-dimensional light-guiding structures. Femtosecond laser-written devices remain highly robust and functional at room temperature, integrating hundreds of photonic degrees of freedom on a few cm long chip. We study fundamental physical phenomena employing such devices that can have potential applications in quantum optics, telecommunication, sensing and medical science. <br />
