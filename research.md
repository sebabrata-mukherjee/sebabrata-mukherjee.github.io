### Research

Our goal is to apply photonic technologies to discover new physics and find their applications, going beyond the traditional scope of 
optics and condensed matter physics. We study how optical states propagate along intricately designed waveguide networks that are 
created inside a few cm long glass substrates using femtosecond laser pulses. <br />

Our current research topics include <br />

    - Manipulating light transport in evanescently coupled waveguide arrays,
    - Micro-optic device fabrication using femtosecond laser pulses, 
    - Periodically modulated (Floquet) photonic structures,
    - Photonic topological insulators,
    - Optical Kerr nonlinearity
