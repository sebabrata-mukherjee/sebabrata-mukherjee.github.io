Supplementary Movie 1: The linear ($g\! \rightarrow \! 0$) propagation of optical intensity in the SSH lattice for the two-site initial excitation at waveguides 1 and 3 with relative phase $\phi$ indicated on the top. The field of view is smaller than the actual numerics, where $50$ waveguides were considered. Here, we have considered experimentally realized values of $J_{1, 2}$.
