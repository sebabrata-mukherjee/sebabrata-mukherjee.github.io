**Welcome to our research group! We are part of the Department of Physics at IISc Bangalore, India. We are interested in how optical states propagate along intricately designed photonic networks. We create such devices in our lab using femtosecond laser pulses and explore novel light-matter interactions with incredible precision and controllability. Find more details on the above tabs.**
